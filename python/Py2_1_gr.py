# The main function
def main():
    welcome_message()  # causes welcome_message to run
    goodbye_message()


# This function is to welcome people to my program
def welcome_message():
    print('Welcome to my program using functions')
    print('My name is Joe Student')


def goodbye_message():
    print("Goodbye")


# This is the main function that starts the program in # motion
main()  # calls main
